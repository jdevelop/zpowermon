RTLAMR Power Monitor for Pi Zero

Collect metrics from various [AMR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_meter_reading) protocols 
and stream them up to [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/) to receive the continuous stream of
timeseries data.

That could be visualized with Grafana: ![screenshot-1589942348](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/141402/82398829-be911980-9a21-11ea-8ae9-0ae7c2e65104.png)

Also it is quite possible to get the meter data for your apartment if you will figure out the meter ID
